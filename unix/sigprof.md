# SIGPROF

*Profiling timer expired*

-  sent when CPU time used by the process and by the system on behalf of the process elapses

## Handling Signals

- threads can block handling signals
- signal handlers for specific signals can be registered with signature: `void sigprof_handler(int sig_nr, siginfo_t* info, void *context)`

## Thread-directed Signals

- pthread_kill(2) used to send signal from one thread to another
- `raise()` is equivalent to `pthread_kill(pthread_self(), sig);`

## Timers

- real timeâ€™ timer counts down in real (wall clock) time
- virtual time timer counts down in program execution time
- profiling time timer is similar except that it also counts down when the kernel is executing a system call on behalf of the program

## Overhead

- walking the call stack using metadata lookups can be done in well under 100 microseconds
- corresponds to only a 1% slowdown for a 10 millisecond profiling period

## Signal Handler Limitations

- signal handler interrupts normal program execution,
- therefore it is limited in what it can do
-  cannot allocate memory or acquire locks
- therefore stored profile cannot grow dynamically

	- profiler works via SIGPROF (see src/profile_handler.h)
	- looks like its using `backtrace` (see src/stacktrace_generic-inl.h)
